if you're compiling the project, include the AT in this folder as it a small tweak to try and
get audio working properly. However, closing the project has audio memory leaks (all sprites are
destroyed properly though) and I'm not exactly sure how to fix it.

Co-op was not really implemented because I didn't have enough time so you can just leave it out
if you want.
