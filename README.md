Breakout
========

Simple breakout clone done in c++ and Arctic Game Engine.

This project was made in a few weeks for a school assignment.

If you want to compile the project, the engine can be found here:

Oh and, audio is not properly disposed on close.

Co-op was not really implemented because I didn't have enough time so it isn't really functional.
